General framework-wide changes/improvements

- Renamed user interface directory 'gui' to 'ui' as it's more general.

- Moved base/Decibel class into 'units' directory.

- Moved all classes that represent numbers (i.e., a number hierarchy) into 'base/numbers'
  This included Boolean, Complex, Float, Integer, Number and Operators.

- Moved all color classes into 'base/colors'
  This included Cie, Cmy, Color, Hls, Hsv, Hsva, Rgb, Rgba and Yiq.

- Removed 'serialize()' method from base Object.  This method is no longer needed
  and all original functionality has been removed.  Therefore, removed any 'serialize()'
  methods defined you might have defined for your classes.  If you did not defined
  any such method, you probably defined an 'empty' implementation using the
  'EMPTY_SERIALIZE()' macro.  Delete this macro.

base library

   -- Removed all random number generation-oriented classes which included the
      Mersenne Twister algorithm and distibution classes.  C++11 includes
      all of this capability and more.
