General framework-wide changes/improvements

- Renamed user interface directory from 'gui' to 'ui' as it's more general.

- Removed 'serialize()' method from base Object.  This method is no longer needed,
  was rarely used, so all functionality has been removed.  Therefore, in user code,
  remove any 'serialize()' methods you might have defined for your classes.  If
  you did not defined any such method, you probably used the 'EMPTY_SERIALIZE()'
  macro to define something.  Delete this macro.

- Prefixed all 'size_t' types with std (e.g., std::size_t) to clearly indicate
  that this is a type from C++ std library.  This has no impact on API.
  It was done to improve codebase to fully adopt C++ things as opposed to
  global 'C' types.

- Moving to using more brace initialization for types throughout implementation
  code.  This causes a more careful examination of type initialization to take
  place, which should improve the quality of generated code.  For example, it
  prevents accidential narrowing initializations from say 'ints' to 'doubles' or
  'doubles' to 'ints.' This is a time consuming activity to make throughout
  codebase, so this is happening when the opporunity presents itself and
  sufficient time is available.

base library

   -- Removed all random number generation-oriented classes which included the
      Mersenne Twister algorithm and distibution classes.  C++11 includes
      all of this capability and more as part of the standard library.

   -- Moved all classes that represent numeric types into 'base/numeric'
      This included the Boolean, Complex, Float, Integer, Number and Operator
      classes.

   -- Moved all color classes into 'base/colors.'  This included Cie, Cmy, Color,
      Hls, Hsv, Hsva, Rgb, Rgba and Yiq.
  
   -- Moved the base/Decibel class into 'units' directory.
